         * 4 bytes for a,b,c,d and four bytes for yellow heart emoji.

         * In hex, that's 8 bytes:
         *  0x61 0x62 0x63 0x64 0xF0 0x9F 0x92 0x9B

         * Notice how the 4-byte character has all its bytes starting

         * the following layout:
         * ===========
         * Table from RFC 3629
         *
         *    Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence

         *    0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
         * ===========
         *
         * UTF-8 characters are between 1 and 4 bytes long and the exact
         * number of characters in a string can only be discovered by
         * iterating over a byte string looking for multibyte sequences.
         *
         * Let 'u' be the binary representation of our example string.
         *
         * ((u & (ONEMASK * 0x80)):
         *  0000000000000000000000000000000010000000100000001000000010000000
         *
         * Notice how only the 1 positions of the multibyte character remain.
         *
         * Shift that right by 7:
         *  0000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000010000000100000001
         *
         * ((~u) >> 6):
         *  0000001001111010011101100111001001101100001111011000000110110101
         *
         * AND those together:
         *  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000100000001
         *
         * So, our 8 bytes containing one 4-byte multibyte character is now
         * degenerated down into a marker of (4 - 1) 1s signifying our 4 byte
         * character has 3 extra bytes of encoding beyond a "regular"
         * 1-byte-per-character encoding.
         *
         * (u * ONEMASK): (using 'u' mutated by previous assignment)
         *  0000001100000011000000110000001100000011000000110000001000000001
         *
         * ((sizeof(size_t) - 1) * 8): 56
         *
         * Shift (u * ONEMASK) right by 56:
         *  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011
         *
         * And our result is 3.  The number of bytes used by multibyte
         * characters in this 8 byte quanity is 4, but we are only counting the
         * "overflow" character bytes.  Our 4-byte character has 3
         * bytes used by the full UTF-8 encoding.  And that's correct.
         *
         * We have 4 ASCII characters and one 4-byte emoji, for
         * a total of 5 characters in our 8 byte string, and (8 - 3) is
         * the count of *characters* in our 8 byte string.
         *
         * Now 'countMultibyteExtra' is incremented by 3 to track the
         * total number of "additional" bytes used by characters across
         * all characters.
         *
         * We return the total number of characters by subtracting the
         * total number of bytes by the number of "extra" bytes used
         * by UTF-8 characters (but never counting the initial UTF-8
